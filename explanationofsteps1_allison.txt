1)  find the y-intercept of the equation, the point where the line or curve crosses the y-axis.
        The y-intercept is the y-value at x = 0. It is a constant that can raise or lower the curve/line
        Subtract the y-intercept from each y-value so the intercept is now at y = 0. This will make it easier to find the other components of the equation.
        
2)  Find the coefficient multiplying x
        The coefficient is the new y-value at x = 1. This is because a*1^n for any n equals a
        Divide every y-value by the coefficient
        
3)  Find the exponent on x, the power that x is raised to.
        A logarithm is used to find what exponent a number needs to be raised to, to get another known number.  For an equation x^n = y, log_x(y) = n, so the exponent equals log base 2 of the y-value at x = 2. 
        
4)  The final equation is: y = (coefficient)*x^(exponent) + (y intercept)
